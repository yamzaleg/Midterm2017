This is the third R Markdown for the midterm assignment. In this example, you will create a Shiny App using diamonds that you will initate by diamonds<-diamonds.  It is worth 32 points if completed in full. The violin plot should let one choose their X-axis, Y-axis, Color-axis, Colorscale.

## Snapshot of your final version

This is just an image - don't let that confuse you.

That was just an image. If you are confused then just click on this link that comes next.

## Example Fully Working Version

  [What you will create - an example if you click me](http://itg.usc.edu:3838/tgrn510/violinator/)

## Diamonds Version

I have provided a script that gets you started and insures you don't get hung up on some details while still understanding concepts.  Please note that you need to use aes_string as I've done to convert the retuned variable to a string.

For the color schemes, the more the better - but you could choose different at http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_brewer.html

The script below needs a lot of editing to get it to diamonds.  If you think it looks like a pain to edit, the first version of this exam I didn't include it.  Also, the coloring doesn't work - but all you have to do is go to one line on [this page](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-violin-plot-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization) and just add it (6 points off if its published without the color working)

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)

ui2 <- fluidPage(
  fluidRow(
    column(2,
      radioButtons("colorscale", "colorscale:",
               c("Pastel1" = "Pastel1",
                 "Dark2" = "Dark2",
                 "Paired" = "Paired",
                 "Accent"= "Accent")),        
         radioButtons("xaxis", "X-axis:",
               c("color" = "color",
                 "cut" = "cut",

})
# Run the application
